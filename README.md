Please write a simple program, that will receive the following 3 DNA-sequences as input (its up to you to decide, in
which format the input needs to be supplied (e.g. without numbers and spaces) or if you prefer a web application or
the command line reading from stdin or file).

1. G T C A G T C A
2. A G T A G T A C
3. C T C T G A C A

For each cycle from 1 to 8, the software should output, how many of these 3 sequences will light up on the red-
laser-photo, and how many will be visible on the green-laser-photo.
A correct output would be:
- red / green
1. 2 / 1
2. 0 / 2
3. 2 / 1
4. 2 / 3
5. 0 / 0
6. 1 / 3
7. 3 / 1
8. 3 / 2
